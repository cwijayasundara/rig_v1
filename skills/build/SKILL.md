# Build a change

`S` means `node --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/sdlc.ts`.

1. Run `S status --json`. The change (`$0` or the active one) must be at `build`. At `approve`, stop: a person approves first.
2. If HEAD is the trunk, run `git checkout -b sdlc/<slug>`.
3. Read `.rig/changes/<slug>/requirements.md` when it exists: the PRD's own words for this change; never edit it, and a test asserts each row's numbers and limits as written. For each behaviour in spec.md, in order:
   - Write the test that names its B-number, and name it after each acceptance criterion it proves: `test_ac_1_2_...`, or the id (`AC-1.2`) in the test title. `pr` refuses a change whose intent cites an AC that no test names.
   - A test implementing a test-plan case whose Data column names a file (`data/blank-sku.json`) loads that file from the sprint's `.rig/product/sprints/sprint-<N>/testplan/data/`, unchanged, never a copy and never an inline dict.
   - Run it with `S run --expect-fail -- "<test command>"` and see it fail.
   - Write the code.
   - Run `S run -- "<test command>"` and see it pass.
   When `intent.md` has a `from-diff:` line the code already exists: for each behaviour write the test and run it with `S run -- "<test command>"` to see it pass, with no `--expect-fail` step; `/rig:test`'s red-proof then runs the new tests on the base, without the captured code, where they must fail. A test that passes there proves nothing: rewrite the test, never the base.
   Touch only the files plan.md lists. If another file must change, add it under `## Decisions` in plan.md and tell the person, who re-approves. A listed test that pins behaviour this change alters is updated to the new expectation (never an assertion removed or loosened); run the whole suite, not only the new tests, before `/rig:test`.
   When plan.md has `## Phases`, finish and verify one phase before the next, tick it (`- [x]`) and, on a resumed build, start at the first unticked phase.
4. The hooks run the sensors after each edit and at the end of each turn. Fix what they report; when a finding survives your fix, write in one sentence the premise that fix rested on and check it before the next fix. Never weaken a test, a sensor or a contract file.
5. For a large plan, run at most one `general-purpose` agent with model `sonnet` per independent group of files, in the foreground, each with a brief of at most 60 lines: the behaviours, the files and the test command.
6. When every behaviour has a passing test, continue with `/rig:test <slug>` in this turn.
